# SPACEWAR ALMOST FROM SCRATCH
This is an attempt of reproducing the game [spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) using modern programming languages. The idea is to track the progress and time each stage of development in this document. If possible, I want to finish this project in under 24h.

Check it out [here](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/spacewar-almost-from-scratch/)

The game is based in `html5 canvas`, `CSS` and `ES6 javascript`. No extra libraries or engines will be used.

Since I've already worked on a project to reproduce [PONG](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/pong-almost-from-scratch/), I'll be using much of it in here.

## GOALS
* ~~Add `LICENSE.md` and `README.md`~~
* ~~Create `html/canvas` base~~
* ~~Host somewhere~~
* ~~Create the gameloop~~
* Create rendering functions
* Design board
* Create `ship` class
* Create `blackhole` sprite
* Implement gravity mechanics
* Implement collision mechanics
* Create gameover screen
* Create start screen
* Create credits screen
* Create enemy AI
* Add sounds
* Improve webpage
* Get playtesters feedback
* List requests/bugs
* Fix requests/bugs
* Finished!

## Progress Reports
00:00 - Start! This project started October 6th, 2016 at 17:50 (BRT). I'll be timing each step and will be placing the time it took from the beginning along with the achived goal.

00:10 - LICENSE and README
This project is under a [GNU GPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Have fun! :wink:

## 00:15 - Host somewhere
For now, I'll be hosting it in [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) since it's easy deploy. Check it out [here](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/spacewar-almost-from-scratch/)

## 00:15 - `html/canvas` base + gameloop
I'll be borrowing the gameloop and the base from my other project [pong-almost-from-scratch](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/pong-almost-from-scratch/).
