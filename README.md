# SPACEWAR ALMOST FROM SCRATCH
This is an attempt of reproducing the game [spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) using modern programming languages. The idea is to track the progress and time each stage of development in this document. If possible, I want to finish this project in under 24h.

Check it out [here](https://armlessjohn404.github.io/spacewar-almost-from-scratch/)

The game is based in `html5 canvas`, `CSS` and `ES6 javascript`. No extra libraries or engines will be used.
